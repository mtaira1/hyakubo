    <blockquote><p class="scroll">my name is Hyaku Kubo.</p>
<p class="scroll">I was born and raised in Tokyo. At 19, I decided it was time for me to leave what I knew and&nbsp; the city I spent my whole life in to chase dreams and see that world outside. Los Angeles, I had imagined, looked to be a dream-like city of possibility, bright lights, a city of “kira kira.”</p>
<p class="scroll">When I arrived in California, the energy of the city, the different kinds of people, their cultures, their look and their language were all so overwhelming, but there was a pull here in Los Angeles that made me feel, “I can do something here.”&nbsp;<br>
Once here, I got swept up in the “Kira Kira” world I had always imagined and met someone who shifted the world I knew. The same age as myself, he had traveled all over the world because of his passion, his work.&nbsp; Sitting next to him, though I had just taken the biggest leap of my life so far in moving to LA, I realized how little I knew and how much larger it could all be. This connection opened the door to this world, but the moment someone asked me who I was, I had no real answer. My English was broken, and aside from being a student, I had nothing to show for myself or who I was. Then I picked up a camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="scroll">In the years I have now spent living in Los Angeles and all its “kira-kira,” that behind or underneath these bright beautiful lights, was everyone else. Their realities, their stories, and the emotions threaded between that aren’t visible at first glance. That’s why for this series, I titled it “The Other Side of the Angels,” to show my view of Los Angeles and capture what’s beneath the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="scroll">The camera had changed me. It became the instrument that connected me with the people and their places, beyond just language.<br>
With the photographs in this series for “The Other Side of the Angels,” I want to share the realness of Los Angeles I have seen.</p></blockquote>
